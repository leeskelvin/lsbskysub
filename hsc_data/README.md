# HSC Data Files

Source HSC data, upon which our LSB simulated images are based. 

## Sub-folder Structure

* [calexp](calexp) : HSC SSC DR1 calexp image files (stripped of mask and weight HDUs)
  * files are in the format 'calexp-FACILITY-BAND-TRACT-PATCH.image.fits'
  * originally 57 files, trimmed to two (minimum and maximum density patches)
  * additional raw data added after trimming to final two:
    * GRIZY coverage
    * segmentation check image
    * segmentation check PNG
* [magellip](magellip) : plot of apparent magnitude as a function of half-light radii and ellipticity 
    * used to calibrate ellipticities 
* [magradii](magradii) : plot of apparent magnitude as a function of half-light radius 
    * used to extrapolate half-light radii to the brightest (and faintest) regimes 
* [numcounts](numcounts) : plots of galaxy number counts as a function of magnitude
* [patchden](patchden) : analysis of field densities for original 57 HSC SSC DR1 patches
* [psf](psf) : PSF generation
* [rgbstamp](rgbstamp) : RGB postage stamp images
* [sourcecats](sourcecats) : generation of source catalogues for 57 unique tract/patch r-band HSC SSC DR1 images
  * one catalogue and one analysis check image (segmentation map) for each of the original 57 patches
  * additionally contains defaults SExtractor config files
  * threshold level histogram and ancilliary data
