# examples

Some basic examples, testing the capabilities of GalSim

## example01

A simple de Vaucouleurs bulge + exponential disk, with 25 added star-forming knots at 1% of the disk level. Poisson noise added, and image convolved with a Moffat PSF.

## example02

A test at reading in catalogue data from an external file. A similar galaxy as in example01 is used, with a varying SF knot flux from 1-15% (ensuring always that knot flux + disk flux = 90%).
