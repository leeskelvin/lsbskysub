# GalSim Testing

Testing of several core features of GalSim, with a mind towards producing relevant simulated images for further use in our LSB science efforts. 

## Sub-folder Structure

* [demos](demos) : copy of GalSim demo files
* [tests](tests) : LSK constructed example files, testing various aspects of GalSim
* [elliptest](elliptest) : a comparison of simulated profiles (using GalSim, GALFIT and IMFIT) at varying ellipticities
* [radiustest](radiustest) : a comparison of various radial measurements, and a stress test of SExtractor profile fitting
* [profiletest](profiletest) : testing profile generation and mapping
